# Rprojects
This repository is primarily to save work for my statistical learning class. There is a lot of room for going deeper in these assignments, so I'm also hoping to end up with some work that I'm proud of.

All finalized work is in R Markdown files (.Rmd). Other files are either supplemental (data sets) or tangential (.R files for drafting).

Concepts covered so far:
- classification
- simple linear regression
- multiple linear regression
- linear discriminant analysis
