# HW1: College and Boston
A brief analysis of two datasets to get familiar with R and some basic statistical concepts.

## hw1.pdf
This contains the full analysis in a printable format.

## hw1.html
Same content is pdf in html format.

## hw1.Rmd
This file contains all analyses and R code.

## hw1.R
An incomplete iteration of the application questions used for testing purposes.
I am keeping this file in case I want to come back to this. It is much faster to
run R scripts than it is to knit a whole Rmarkdown file.

## College.csv
The data used in the first application question.
